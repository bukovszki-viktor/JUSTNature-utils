## Data quality assurance utilities
This folder will include pre-processing tools based on third-party data sources specified in T3.2. A description of the SmartCEPS Data Quality Assessment and its approach will be given, along with how it ensures the quality of the collected data in accordance with its established dimensions. The data principles in the SmartCEPS DQA would be listed, namely data resolution, reasonableness, robustness, completeness, and actionability. For each data quality principle, the requirements for the different data quality checks, the different data quality plans, and the different external tools will be identified. Other alternate data quality assurance plans or principles found in the literature would be mentioned. Additionally, the IES' iSCAN web-based tool towards existing data of JUSTNature will be presented. This chapter will elaborate the toolâ€™s method to centralize and analyze time series data and identify hidden insights. Lastly, the utilities for data quality assurance, linked to the IES iSCAN, and the monitoring framework are presented.
