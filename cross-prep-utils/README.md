## Cross-NbS preparation utilities

This folder establishes specific requirements and measurable metrics for comparability across different CiPeLs of the project. These include a metric and calculation method for a similarity index, a benchmark-suitability index, and a matchmaking-suitability index. These indices are applied and demonstrated in a comparative presentation of monitoring results of the CiPeLs.
